## Projects
### Binding host proteins to the M protein contributes to the mortality associated with influenzaâ€“Streptococcus pyogenes superinfections
This published research project ffers a fresh perspective on the longstanding challenge of understanding how Influenza A Virus and Streptococcus pyogenes interact in a mouse model. This project investigates the connection between host proteins and the M protein in influenza-Streptococcus pyogenes superinfections, shedding light on their role in mortality.

### Predicting the onset of Hypertension based on Age,Gender,Cholesterol level and BMI using Machine Learning Models.
My dissertation project focused on predicting the onset of hypertension using machine learning models and comparing the performances of all the models used. By analyzing key factors such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and BMI, my aim was to develop an accurate prediction system. This innovative approach will provide valuable insights into early hypertension detection, facilitating proactive healthcare interventions and improved patient outcomes.
